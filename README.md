Simply put a recipe manager app. After my lengthy honeymoon visiting amazing countries and trying lots of food, I've been inspired to try cooking some of the meals I tried whilst away, and I need somewhere to save all my favourite recipes.


Concept: Store, edit, and view recipes with ingredients, steps, tags, and cooking time.

Core Skills:

CRUD functionality using JSON server or Firebase

Forms with validation (e.g., react-hook-form + Zod or Yup)

Type-safe recipe schema

Custom hooks for fetching and updating recipes

Stretch Goals:

Add search and filtering

Use drag-and-drop to reorder ingredients or steps
